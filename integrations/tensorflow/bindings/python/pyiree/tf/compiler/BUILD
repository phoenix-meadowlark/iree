# Runtime deps needed to compile the tensorflow compiler.
# As of 2020-04-13, robust constant folding is dependent on the legacy
# TensorFlow executor, which requires kernels to operate on/simplify
# the graph. This should become less necessary as more robust support
# is implemented as part of the MLIR-based tf2xla bridge. This adds
# about ~350 files to the system, many of which are quite heavy to
# compile. Excluding them disables TensorFlow constant propagation,
# which can cause non-optimized binaries (and tickle bugs and unimplemented
# features). However, it is allowed, especially for development because it
# is such a burden to build them. Disable kernels with this command line
# options:
#   --define=PYIREE_TF_DISABLE_KERNELS=1
# See: https://github.com/google/iree/issues/1506
